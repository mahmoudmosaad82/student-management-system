# student-management-system
The program is a student management system designed for use in higher education institutions. Its main purpose is to help university members manage and track student information such as personal details, enrollment, course registration, academic performance, and other related data.

The program likely includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using a Python framework such as Tkinter. The interface may include input fields and buttons for data entry, as well as display tables and charts to visualize student data.

The program may also have a backend database to store and manage the data entered through the interface. This database may be designed using a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as PostgreSQL, and data may be accessed and manipulated through SQL queries.
## keep in mind that the database server is localhost on my own device.
Overall, the student management system aims to make it easier for university staff and faculty to manage and monitor student progress, and to provide a more efficient and streamlined approach to student data management.
